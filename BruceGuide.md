Brobot Controls are still rather primitive! 
##### Startup the controller
Normally, the controller will already be set up with the Brain. Hit the power button in the center of the controller the indicator LED will *Blink White* then glow *Solid Blue* when connected to the computer.   

##### Pairing the device
TODO: add screenshots    
In the event that you need to setup a controller with a Brobot Brain, follow these steps:     
1. Setup the Brobot Brain at a monitor and keyboard station as you will need to access the *Bluetooth menu*
2. If there are entries for "wireless controller", delete them, as they could be duplicates. 
3. Enter the controller into *pairing mode* by holding down the *share* button before and during powering on the controller.
4. The controller should show up as a device in the Bluetooth settings as "not setup", click connect
5. The process in complete when the indicator LED on the controller glows *Solid Blue*

If anything starts sparking or smoking you should head to safety and probably call the fire department.
