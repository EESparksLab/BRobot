# BRobot

Brace root-robot (known as BRobot) is a project that resulted from a 2018 CAT EPoC grant. 
This grant proposed the development of a sub-canopy robot that could capture hard to reach data in corn fields. 

The code for this project is here labeled brobot, the joystick arduino code, this is in a folder named rc_joy. 

Data processing of images occurs through the Root Tagging GUI in an associated repository.


The BRobot methods were released in:
Stager A, Tanner HG and Sparks EE. “Design and Construction of Unmanned Ground Vehicles for Sub-Canopy Plant Phenotyping” arXiv, 2019.

The BRobot was used in a publication:
Hostetler AN, Erndwein L, Reneau JW, Cantera W, Stager A, Tanner HG, Cook DD and Sparks EE. 
“Brace root phenotypes predict root lodging susceptibility and the contribution to anchorage in maize” bioRxiv, 2021.
